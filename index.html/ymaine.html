	<h1> Why University of Maine? </h1>

	<p> When I tell people that I am from Pennsylvania they all ask one question, "Why would
	you come to Maine?" I love cold weather and hockey. This University has both! I am not sure 
	what to expect with the coming winter, so far its been really cold and 
	we've barely gotten any any snow. But I have a feeling that it wont be too bad. I miss my PA friends
	but ive made new and good ones here, so I think that this si a good place and im excited
	to hopefully come back next year.  </p>
